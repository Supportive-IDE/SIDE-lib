# SIDE-lib

## Quick Start
The entry point for the library is `SIDE-lib/index.js`. This file contains three functions:
* `parse(json_str)`: Takes a string of Python source code and returns a JSON object containing information about the symptoms and misconceptions detected in the source code. 
* `symptomInfo()`: Returns a JSON object listing all symptoms currently supported by SIDE-lib.
* `misconceptionInfo()`: Returns a JSON object listing all misconceptions currently supported by SIDE-lib.
